Visualization code for data collected using Open Data Kit
--------------------
This code helps visualize results from Open Data Kit in Google Earth and/or
Google Maps by creating KML files from survey responses.




Sanitized Data
--------------------
The visualization code expects sanitized input.  The sample of data I had from
Uganda wasn't clean at all, though.  sanitize_csv.py is a quick-and-dirty script
which discards data that isn't in the right format for the visualization code.
